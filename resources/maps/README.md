# Contents of Folder

This folder contains bitmaps representing different map layouts for the game. All bitmaps should
be 24-bit and be made to be a few hundred pixels in width and height. Each pixel is a tile, and only
tiles should be represented on these maps. Entities should be spawned separately.
