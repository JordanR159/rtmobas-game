## Installation
For those who need some assistance on setting up this github repository on their local machine :

*As a side note, we created this through CLion and only provide steps for that*

### Windows
#### 1. Install MinGW x64 and create CLion Toolchain
#### 2. Download SFML 2.5.0 - MinGW Version *(YOU MUST HAVE THIS VERSION)*
#### 3. Place SFML 2.5.0 as the Folder "SFML" inside the local repository
#### 4. Set MinGW/bin as a new environmental variable under advanced system settings
#### 5. Either set SFML/bin as another environmental variable or move all the dll files inside SFML/bin into C:/Windows/System32/... Another choice is to have a global copy of SFML inside C:/Program Files/ and set that as a new environmental variable.
#### 6. You are ready to go
